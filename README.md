# DisneyDown
Downloads Disney+ content using a Widevine Hex-formatted key (32-character AES content key).

You need to obtain this key using either using the Chrome WidevineDecryptor plugin or another method. We cannot provide keys; don't bother asking.

`DisneyDown.Console.exe -?` for help on using this program
